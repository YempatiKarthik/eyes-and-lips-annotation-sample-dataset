# Eyes and Lips Annotation Sample Dataset

This dataset is used for eyes and lips segmentation of people faces. 

Originally this dataset is taken and inspired from 

1. https://github.com/switchablenorms/CelebAMask-HQ 
2. http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

For easy reference and use case I edited few images for eyes and lips segmentation.
